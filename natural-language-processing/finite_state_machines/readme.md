I learned how to write markup code that can be used to generate graphs, which I didn't know was possible to do with GraphViz. It turns out that making graphs with GraphViz is pretty easy. At first I thought that it would be faster to just use a tool like LucidChart or PowerPoint and drag-and-drop the shapes and arrows, but I can see now that writing the markup code and letting GraphViz make the chart is sometimes more efficient.

I made two automatons for the extra practice. The first is an FSM that represents the regular expression /he+l+o+/. This FSM would match the following strings: hello, heeellloooo, hellllooo, etc. State #4 is a double circle, indicating that it is the "accepting state," and will be continue to be such as long as an "o" is given as an input. For my 2nd automaton, I wanted to represent an actual machines, so I chose to model a printer. In this case the accepting state was when the printer was idle. The FSM covers the possibilities of recieving a request to print papers, as well as the posibilities of missing ink or a paper jam.
