I attended school here for 2 years of my undergraduate degree. It is a good education for the money. It is a safe environment.  It is also very cold here in the winter time. The culture is very different here. I remember when i went to register for classes i was denied entry because i was not wearing socks with my shoes. It was so frustrating. That was a little extreme IMO.
