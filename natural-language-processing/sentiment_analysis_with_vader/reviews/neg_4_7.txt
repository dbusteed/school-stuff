I liked BYU at first, but over time the poor culture and excessive rules got to me.  If you fail a class, you can't replace the grade if you retake it.  Ironic coming from a school sponsored by a church that preaches repentance.  Once I was not allowed to renew my ID card because I had hair that was long enough to be combed over my ears (even though it was not combed over my ears).  Apparently my appearance was not perfect enough to be acceptable at the Lord's school.
