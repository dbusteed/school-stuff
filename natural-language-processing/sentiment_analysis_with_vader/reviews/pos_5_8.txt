Outstanding university with a talented pool of students. Situated in one of the most breathtakingly scenic locations for a university campus, with stunning mountains on the doorstep of the school, your walks to class will be often awe-inspiring. There has been a lot of updating on the campus. Make no mistake, this is a unique environment that won't be for everyone. But for active members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or those who like the clean-cut environment, it is a great place to get an education. Though it has a well-deserved reputation as being very conservative, you will find a lot more political diversity here than you expect on many issues. And with the majority of students from outside the state of Utah, in many ways, it is more diverse than any other school in Utah, and less in the "bubble" than critics often claim.  Great place to get an education. And the cost for the value is incredible!
