BYU is an elitist organization, regardless of any preaching against pride. Atmosphere is nice and clean. It is a pleasure to walk around campus without any cigarette smoke stench. Tuesday devotionals are always a pleasant break from collegiate rigors. The primary reason BYU is not a great school is because it exists to test and not to teach. The general construct of their education is challenging students to "weed"them out instead of teaching students to help them advance in their desired career goals. Classes are always big and TAs do more teaching than professors do. Primarily because professors are more invested in research than in teaching. You only get one shot at a degree at BYU. They don't let you get two majors. If you really want an education in Utah county, then go to UVU.
