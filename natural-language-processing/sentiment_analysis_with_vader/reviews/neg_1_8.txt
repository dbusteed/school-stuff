As an active member of the LDS church, l was absolutely appalled at the behavior and atmosphere that took place on BYU campus. I love the LDS church, and this review is by no means a review towards the church. 
The atmosphere is full of 'survival of the fittest'. If you have any questions, you instantly become a social outcast. It's as if you not understanding the material will somehow bring down anyone who associates with you. 
I was also appalled at how little the church's doctrine was enforced, mainly the law of chastity. Members of the church are not supposed to arouse sexual feelings before marriage. As l would walk across campus, l would constantly see people full on making out, sometimes even lying on top of each other on the lawn. 
Yeah, not too impressed.
