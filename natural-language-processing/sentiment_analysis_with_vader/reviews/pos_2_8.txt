Most well organized campus in the state. This campus is also recognized around the world as being one of the best landscaped and has one several awards. Parking here is not as bad as the u or u.v.u,the wilk is a great place to hang out and chill with your homies. I would recommend attending here to anyone looking to go to college were they can simply learn how to get around and get a feel for the campus. Down town Provo also has a unique university city vibe.
