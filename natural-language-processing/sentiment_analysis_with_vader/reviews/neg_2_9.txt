I HATE this school so so much. I feel like I made the worst decision by coming to this school. When I wake up every morning, the first thing come up in my mind is whatever homework is due, and the last thing I do everyday is to finish typing all the essays I have from the classes. I feel like I can not breath from those pressures. I encourage everyone please DO NOT come to BYU, it is worse than going to hell!!!!
