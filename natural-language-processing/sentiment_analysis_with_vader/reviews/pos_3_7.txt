Best university for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Very good university for people of other faiths—especially Christian—that support high morals and values for themselves or their children. The Honor Code is great because it allows you or your children to participate in a great learning experience without making mistakes you’ll regret later in life. The only downside to the University could be the lack of diversity but it’s nothing to lose sleep over.
