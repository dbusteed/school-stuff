Not being from Utah, it is hard sometimes falling into this culture. However, the pros far outweigh the cons. There are lots of great people here from professors to students. The parking is atrocious and some of the staff is irrational and quite frankly rude, but the overall experience is amazing. Education and life cannot be any better than here in Provo at BYU
