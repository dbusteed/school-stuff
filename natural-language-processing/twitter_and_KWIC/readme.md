For my mini-corpus, I collected Japanese tweets that contain variations of the personal pronoun "I", that were written using the standard Japanese scripts (Hiragana or Katakana), rather than the borrowed Chinese characters (Kanji). I think this is linguistically intersting, because it seems strange to me why Japanese Twitter users wouldn't use the Kanji in order to lessen their character count. Does writing out "わたし"　compared to "私"　convey a different meaning? Is it more conversational, and therefore more suited for Twitter? In what cases do native Japanese people use one over the other?

I used Python + Tweepy (the Twitter API for Python) to stream in the live tweets, filtering tweets that contained one of the five different ways to write "I". As new tweets arrived, I saved them to a text file. In another Python script, I cleaned the tweets by removing retweets and fixing some unicode errors. These cleaned tweets were saved to a seperate file.

In this assignment, I became more familiar with some new corpus analysis tools, primiarly those that provide KWIC search for a given corpus. I used an online KWIC tool found at http://esl.fis.edu/grammar/analysis/concord.htm to get familiar with what KWIC is and how it works. I also downloaded and used the AntConc tool, which I thought was very easy to use. I also experiemented with NLTK in the interactive Python shell, and explored the tools provided at english-corpora.org and lds-general-conference.org.
