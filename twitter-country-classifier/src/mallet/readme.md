Using MALLET was somewhat of an afterthought, and I did it just for fun. It turned out to produce really good models though, so if you're interested, follow the download instructions [here](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php). (FYI you'll need Java installed on your system).

Download the `tweets.mallet` file from this directory, change the paths found in `mallet_models.ps1` and you should be able to run it from here.

If you are using a UNIX-based system, just edit the PowerShell script and make it work with Bash (shouldn't be that hard).
